        <p>Revered as one of the greatest motorcycles of all time, the Yamaha R1 has been dominating the track and the roads for well over 20+ years until this point. After a major overhaul back in 2020, the newest generation of R1 continues to storm on into the sunset with very minor changes in the last 2 years; this year included.</p>
        <p>The R1 comes complete with a 998 inline-four mill capable of an astounding 198 horsepower and 83 lb-ft of torque. The rider safety systems that help manage this beast-of-an-engine got an update last year, meaning that the anti-wheelie, anti-skid- and stability control systems have all-new maps applied that have been carried over to 2022.</p>

        <p>The high-performance Ford Focus RS is the top performance version of Ford's compact car. Offered only as a four-door hatchback, the Focus RS is powered by a 350-horsepower, turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine that drives all four wheels through a six-speed manual transmission.</p>
        <p>The result is a zero-to-62-mph time of as little as 4.7 seconds, according to Ford. Competitors include the Volkswagen Golf R, Subaru WRX STI and Honda Civic Type R.</p>

        <p>When it comes to cheap speed, there is no single BMW that even comes close to the E90/E92 M3. BMWs first foray into turbocharged petrol cars was a revelation when it was launched way back in 2006.  Its basically the German Supra and is powered by Munichs 2JZ, the N54.</p>
        <p>With 306bhp and 295lb ft of torque straight out of the box, it was an incredibly rapid machine from factory. Once the tuners unlocked the potential within that remarkable engine, all hell broke loose. The N54 became the stuff of legend on the BMW tuning scene. Its successor, the N55, is less of an out-and-out powerhouse but it too has some serious modding potential. Whichever version of the BMW E92 335i you end up choosing, youre going to have a lot of fun.</p>
